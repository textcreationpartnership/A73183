            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Well then <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy,</hi> or <hi>Hereſis</hi> (as we tearme it in latine) is a greek word, ſignifying as much as <hi>Electio, Election</hi> or <hi>choyce,</hi> comming of the greeke Verb <hi>aireo,</hi> in latin <hi>Eligo,</hi> to <hi>chooſe</hi> or make choice of. So as this word <hi>Haereſis,</hi> originally and primatiuely, ſignifyeth ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or choice (as is ſayd) in generall; yet becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe they, who deuide themſelues by maintayning falſe opinions from the Church of Chriſt, doe make choyce of theſe their new opinions, and ſo therby do ſeparate themſelues from the Church; therefore this word <hi>Haereſis</hi> (looſing its former ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſignification) is reſtrained by the Apoſtles, and the ancient Fathers, through an Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call vſe and acceptance (which courſe we finde houlden in diuers other wordes, as the wordes <hi>Apoſtolus, Chriſtus, Baptiſma,</hi> and many other now taken by the Church in a ſecondary acceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) to ſignify any falſe and new opinion, or Religion, of which a man maketh choyce, and pertinaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly defendeth it againſt the Church of God; &amp; the maintainours thereof, are commonly ſtilled
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:150754:7"/> Heretikes. Thus <hi>Hereſy</hi> (in its true and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall definition) is any falſe opinion touchinge fayth and Religion, contumaciouſly defended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and his Church. This definition (I meane in taking the word <hi>Haereſis</hi> and <hi>Haereticus,</hi> in this reſtrained ſenſe) is warranted by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, by the ancient Fathers. And laſtly (to omit the like acknowledgement of the Catholikes) by the learned Proteſtants. By the Apoſtle; for thus we find him to ſay: <hi>There must be Hereſies among you, that they which are approued among you, may be knowne</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. As alſo: <hi>A man that is an Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, after the firſt and ſecond admonition, auoide. Tit.</hi> 3. And finally: <hi>Thoſe which were of the hereſy of the Sadduces, laid hands vpon the Apoſtles. Act.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By the ancient Fathers. For S. Hierome in cap. 3. ad Tit. ſhewing the difference between hereſy and ſchiſme, thus defineth hereſy: <hi>Haereſis est, quae peruerſum dogma habet. Hereſy is that which containeth a peruerſe and froward opinion.</hi> And S. Auguſtine in like manner <hi>lib. de fide &amp; ſimbolo cap.</hi> 10. defineth hereſy in theſe wordes: <hi>Haeretici ſunt, qui de Deo falſa ſentiendo fidem violant: Heretikes are thoſe, who do violate their fayth by houlding falſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions touching God.</hi> By the Proteſtants: for to name one or two among many, <hi>M. Ormerod</hi> (a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:150754:8"/> moſt forward Proteſtant) thus defineth an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike: <hi>He is an Heretike, who ſo ſwarueth from the wholeſome doctrine, as contemning the iudgment of God and the Church, perſisteth in his opinion, Dialog.</hi> 2. with whome conſpireth <hi>D. Couell,</hi> ſaying: <hi>Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes are they, who directly gaine-ſay ſome article of our fayth. Exam. p.</hi> 199.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now out of this former definition of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy, I am to premoniſh thee good Reader of two points. firſt, that euery hereſy is maintained with obſtinacy againſt the Church of God, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the maintainours thereof are ſayd by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, that <hi>they went out of vs,</hi> 1. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 2. that is, out of Gods Church; and for the ſame reaſon the Apoſtle pronounceth an Heretike to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his owne iudgment. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. becauſe he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth his iudgment before the iudgment of the whole Church; from which conſideration it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that what man ſoeuer houldeth any erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous opinion touching fayth, and being aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed thereof by Gods Church, and not yealding his iudgment in all humility therto, is thereby become an Heretike. And ſuch is the ſtate of Catholikes and Proteſtants, ſince the one doth euer reciprocally charge and condemne the other with falſe doctrine, &amp; therfore ſeeing the church
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:150754:8"/> of Chriſt muſt be with one of them, it followeth, that the other not ſubmitting their iudgments to it, are proclaimed thereby Heretikes. And thus it may ſometimes fall out, that the firſt inuentor of a falſe opinion may be no Heretike, as maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it before it be condemned by the church; whereas the Profeſſors of it, after its condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are become Heretikes, according to that of <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis,</hi> in his worthy booke againſt the prophane innouation of the hereſyes of his tyme. <hi>O admirable change of thinges, the authors of one and the ſame opinion are esteemed Catholikes; and their followers Heretikes!</hi> Thus we ſee that pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of iudgment, doth conſumate an Hereſie.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſecond is, that the aforeſayd defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hereſy (being the only true definition, and acknowledged for ſuch by all ſides) is not reſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, eyther in it ſelfe, or by the meaning of the Apoſtle (as by his wordes ſet downe in the next chapter following, may more eaſily appeare) on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the moſt principall and (as they are called) fundamentall points of chriſtian fayth, as of the Trinity, the Incarnacion of Chriſt, his Paſſion, the Decalogue and the articles of the creed, but it is extended in its owne Nature (conſidering to Logicke the definition, and the thing defined,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:150754:9"/> ought to be of an equall latitude or lardgnes) to any erroneous opinion whatſoeuer, frowardly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by a man, and gainſayed by the Church of God: So as, it is as perfit an Hereſy (and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers therof are as true Heretiks) to deny, that there is a Purgatory, or to deny Freewill, Prayer to Saints, the doctrine of Indulgences, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Baptiſme, or any other article approued by the Catholike Church (granting the doctrine of the Catholikes in theſe articles to be true) as to deny the Trinity, the Incarnation of Chriſt, his Death or Paſſion &amp;c. And a man ſhalbe aſwell damned in hell for denying theſe former, as for theſe other; though the denyall of theſe later, do exceed the other in mallice; ſince the Hereſies of them are more wicked &amp; blaſphemous. And thus much touching the definition of Hereſie, or an Heretike, which being iuſtly premiſed, we will now come to the maine controuerſie handled in this Treatiſe.</p>

               <p n="5">5. Now what can be replyed againſt theſe former Texts? It cannot be ſayd, that they are meant only of ſuch Heretikes, as deny the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes of the Trinity, the Incarnation of Chriſt, his Paſſion, and ſuch like ſupreme and cardinall points of Chriſtian Religion: this (I ſay) cannot be auerred for theſe reaſons following. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe, who in the Apoſtles tymes, denyed theſe principall points of Chriſtianity, could not be truely tearmed Heretikes (ſeeing he is truely
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:150754:11"/> an Heretike, who was once a member of Chriſts church by fayth, but after ceaſeth to be thereof) no more then all the Iewes or Gentils could not be accounted or ſtyled Heretikes, becauſe they neuer beleeued the foreſayd myſteryes of chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Secondly by reaſon, that according to the former definition of Hereſy or Heretikes aboue ſet downe, the former Texts haue a neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, to all Hereſy and heretikes whatſoeuer, whether the ſubiect of the ſayd falſe opinion be ſmall or great. Thirdly, becauſe that in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Texts of Scripture, there is no reſtriction of the word <hi>Haereticus</hi> or <hi>Haereſis,</hi> to the chiefe or hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheſt points of Chriſtian Religion, but it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all kind of Heretikes or Hereſies what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, euen by the Apoſtle without exception, who (no doubt) if he had vnderſtood Hereſyes, or Heretiks only in the greateſt points (at leaſt in ſome one Text or other, among ſo many) would accordingly haue reſtrayned his wordes, only to thoſe kind of Heretikes; and the rather ſeeing the denyall of thoſe great points only (not of others) do in our Libertines opinion, make the denyers thereof Heretikes. But not to leaue the leaſt ſhow of refuge or euaſion, heerin I will produce ſome paſſages of holy Scripture, in which the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours

               <p n="7">7. A ſecond place shalbe that of the former Apoſtle, who writing of certaine Heretiks erring touching the Reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the body, ſayth thus: <hi>Their</hi>

From which it euidently followeth, that theſe Heretikes continuing and dying in the foreſayd hereſy, could not be ſaued;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:150754:13"/> ſince that fayth, which erreth from the truth, and which ſubuerteth the true fayth of others, and which in killing and deſtroying the ſoule, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth a Canker, cannot afford ſaluation to its Profeſſors.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Another paſſage, which heere I will vrge, is that of S. Iohn, who calleth certaine Heretiks, <hi>Anti-Chriſts,</hi> ſaying: <hi>Now</hi>

               <p n="9">9.

But theſe things hard to be vnderſtood in <hi>S.

               <p n="10">10. That thoſe difficulties in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> epiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, intimated by Sainct Peter, doe not concerne the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Paſſion, &amp;c. I proue ſeuerall wayes: firſt becauſe S. Peter ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no ſuch mention, which no doubt he would haue done, if the ſubiect of them had touched on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe ſupreme myſteries, and were not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to other inferiour points.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Secondly it is acknowledged by the commentaries and writings of all the fathers (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the epiſtles themſelues ſhowe no leſſe)

               <p n="13">13. <hi>The ſame is proued from the definition and propriety of faith.</hi> In this place we will take into our conſideration, the definition of fayth ſet down by S. <hi>Paul;</hi> ſecondly the dignity &amp; worth of faith much celebrated by diuers of the Apoſtles; third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the inſeparable propriety of fayth, which is vnity; for ſo doth the Scripture delineate and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe fayth: from all which it will ineuitably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the fayth, which ſaueth man, is not to be reſtrayned only to the Trinity, the Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and other ſuch ſublime points of Chriſtian Religion (though in other points it be erroneous) but is extended to all other pointes whatſoeuer, which the Church of God propoundeth to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued.</p>
               <p n="14">14. And to beginne with the definition of fayth giuen by the Apoſtle, he the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> defineth fayth thus: <hi>Fayth</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>is the ſubſtance of thinges to be hoped for, the argument of thinges not appearing:</hi> The ſenſe whereof is this: firſt that fayth through an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible certainty cauſeth thoſe thinges to ſubſiſt, and haue a being in the mind of man, which thinges
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:150754:15"/> are yet to come, being but hoped and looked for: ſecondly, that fayth cauſeth the vnderſtanding to giue aſſent to thoſe points, which it vnderſtandeth not, acknowledging them to be more certaine, then any thinges whatſoeuer, according to thoſe wordes of S. Thomas: <hi>Multo magis</hi>

                  <hi>homo certior eſt de eo, quod audiuit a Deo, qui falli non potest, quam de eo, quod videt propria ratione, quae falli poteſt.</hi> Now heere (I truſt) no man will deny, but the Apoſtle defineth that fayth of a Chriſtian, which ſaueth him. This being graunted (for to deny it, were both impious in the denyer, and moſt iniurious to the Apoſtle) we are to remember, the nature of euery true definition ſet downe by the Logitians, to wit (as is aboue mentioned) that the thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and the definition, be of one and the ſame extent and latitude; ſo as whatſoeuer is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended vnder the definition, the ſame is alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned vnder the thing defined. This then being preſuppoſed by force of all reaſon (for Logicke is but an artificiall and ſeruiceable handmayd vnto reaſon) we find that this definition of fayth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſeth in it ſelfe, not only the doctrine of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, the Trinity, and the like, and this not articulately, but only by way of deduction; but alſo it contayneth al ſecondary points of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:150754:15"/> ſeeing the former definition doth predicate, or may be ſayd, of all the ſayd ſecondary &amp; leſſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall points of Religion, controuerted betweene Chriſtians at any tyme.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Therfore the thing heere defined, which is the ſauing fayth of a Chriſtian, is in like ſort to extend it ſelfe to all the ſayd ſecondary pointes of Religion, how indifferent ſoeuer they ſeeme in mans iudgment. This inference is ſo demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue (being taken from the former definition of fayth) as that the Apoſtle himſelfe preſently after the former wordes, beginning to inſtance in the ſeuerall obiects of fayth (among diuers other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples) ſetteth downe, that to belieue Noas flood or the deluge of the world by water for ſinne, is an article of fayth: for thus he ſayth: <hi>By fayth Noah hauing receaued an anſwere concerning thoſe thinges, which as yet were not ſeene, fearing, framed the Arke for the ſauing of his houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. But to proceed further; if the articles of the Trinity, the Incarnation and the like, be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſſentiall points of a true Chriſtian fayth, it is more then wounderfull, that the Apoſtle vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to ſet downe the true definition of an auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leable fayth, and exemplifying it, in ſeuerall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, ſhould wholely and ſilently omit the ſayd
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:150754:16"/> articles of the Trinity, Incarnation, Paſſion, &amp;c. he in that chapter not expreſſely ſpeaking one word of them. And thus much touching the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of fayth giuen by the Apoſtle: from which definition we conclude, that who ſeeketh to haue a true fayth neceſſary to ſaluation, (beſides the myſteryes of the Trinity, the Incarnation &amp;c.) muſt belieue diuers other dogmaticall articles of Chriſtian Religion. And therefore anſwearably heerto, we aſſure our ſelues, that when our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſayd: <hi>He</hi>
                  <note n="(q)" place="margin">

                  <hi>that beleeueth not, shalbe condemned.</hi> He did ſpeak of the belieuing (at leaſt implicitly) of the whole corps of Chriſtian fayth and doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and not only of any one part thereof; for ſo in this latter manner it would be both falſe &amp; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd. In like ſort where our Bleſſed Sauiour in the ſame chapter ſayth to his Apoſtles: <hi>Preache the Ghoſpell to all Creatures.</hi> He did vnderſtand the whole Ghoſpell; which contayneth many other points beſides the Trinity, Incarnation, Paſſion, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="17">17. In this next place we will deſcend to thoſe paſſages of holy Scripture, which do much mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the efficacy and vertue of fayth. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly hereunto we find it is ſayd: <hi>He</hi>

Now then this vnity of fayth is ſo to be vnderſtood, as that it is not repugnant therto, that one and the ſame point ſhould at one tyme not be houlden, as neceſſarily to be beleeued, the which, after it hath vndergone a definitiue and ſententionall decree of Gods Church, is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to be belieued: As for example, it was not neceſſary in the beginning of Chriſtianity to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that the booke of the Machabees, the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of S. Iames, S. Iude, the ſecond epiſtle of S. Peter, the 2. and 3. of S. Iohn, to be Canonicall Scripture, till they were defined ſo to be by the third Councell of Carthage, <hi>Can.</hi> 47. at which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was preſent. But after this Councell had by the aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt, defined them to be Canonicall, then it was, and is hereſy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them to be Cononical. And the reaſon of this diſparity is, becauſe it is Gods good pleaſure and wiſedome, not to reueale to his Church al articles of fayth in the beginning and at one tyme, but at ſeuerall tymes, and vpon ſeuerall occaſions, as to his diuine maieſty beſt ſeemeth expedient. Thus the fayth of a Chriſtian is capable of dilatation, and of a more lardge vnfoulding or expoſition, but not of any contrariety in beliefe, change, or alteration. And thus (to inſiſt in the former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample)
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:150754:18"/> it may well ſtand with Chriſtian fayth in the beginning, not to accept the former bookes for canonicall, till the authority of the Churche had pronounced them for ſuch; but it ſtandeth not with true fayth, that one man ſhould poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely beleeue as an articie of fayth, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabees and the reſt of the bookes aboue ſpecify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are not canonical Scripture, but the prophane writtinges of man. And another man ſhould at the ſame tyme beleeue, as an article of fayth, that they are canonicall Scripture; ſince the one of theſe contrary beliefes, muſt be Heretical.</p>
               <p n="20">20. This verity then of the vnity of fayth, being warranted by the word, both of God, and man, as is aboue ſayd, we will take into our conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, the Catholike, and Proteſtants Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all who ioyntly do profeſſe to beleeue in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, in the Trinity, in Chriſt his Incarnation, his Paſſion, and the creed of the Apoſtles; and ſo we ſhall diſcerne, whether the fayth of all theſe ſeuerall profeſſors, doth inioy the foreſayd marke of vnity in doctrine or no.

Next I will demonſtrate, that ſuppoſing all Profeſſors of both Religions, ſhould agree in the true ſence and meaning of the creed; yet there are diuers other dogmaticall points, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to be beleeued, (&amp; are at this inſtant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:150754:19"/> both by Proteſtants and Catholiks) which are not expreſſed or mentioned in the Creed at al; or by any immediate inference to be drawne from thence. Laſtly I will ſet downe the great differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce betweene Catholikes and Proteſtants in other points of fayth, of which the Creed maketh no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation or mention at all, and yet the beliefe of them is houlden neceſſary to ſaluation, both by Catholike and Proteſtant: from all which it ſhall appeare, how far diſtant the Catholike and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion are from that vnity in doctrine, ſo neceſſarily required to that fayth, whereby a Chriſtian is to be ſaued.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I do heere begin with the Apoſtles creed, firſt becauſe the articles of the Trinity, the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Paſſion &amp;c. are included in the creede; Secondly, by reaſon there are many <hi>Adiaphorists</hi> in Religion (as I may tearme them) who ſeeme to deale more lardgly and liberally heerein, ſeeinge they are content to extend the neceſſary obiect of fayth, not only to the articles of the Trinity, the Incarnation, and Paſſion, but to all pointes ſet downe in the creed, who aſſure themſelues, that God exacteth not at our hands the beliefe of any other articles, then what are contained in the creed. Now heere aforehand we are to conceaue,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:150754:19"/> that true fayth reſteth in that true ſenſe and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the wordes of the Creed, which was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Apoſtles, and not in the wordes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, ſeeing both in the iudgment of all learned Catholikes and Proteſtants, to beleeue the words of the creed, in a ſenſe different from the intended ſenſe of the Apoſtles (and conſequently in a falſe ſenſe) is no better, then not to beleeue at all: And the reaſon heereof is, becauſe a falſe conſtruction drawne from the creede (no leſſe then from the Scripture) is not the word of God, but the word of man, and conſequently the ſayd letter of the creed, ſo interpreted, is ſubiect to the ſame cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, whereunto the word of man is lyable; from whence it followeth, that whoſoeuer belieueth the wordes of the creed in another ſenſe, then was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the holy Ghoſt, and the Apoſtles, doth not beleeue the creed at all, but only beleeueth the worde of man, which euer ſtandeth ſubiect to errour and miſtaking. So as the ſentence of Saint Hierome deliuered only of the Scripture, may iuſtly be applyed of the creed: <hi>Scripturae</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">In ep. ad Pauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</note> 
                  <hi>non in legendo, ſed in intelligendo conſistunt. The Scripture (or Creed) doth not conſiſt in the letter, but in the ſenſe, and true vnderſtanding of the letter.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. This then being truly preſuppoſed, let
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:150754:20"/> vs begin to examine the articles of the creed, and ſee how we Catholiks and Proteſtants do differ in the conſtruction and vnderſtanding thereof.

               <p>IN this third and laſt place we will inſiſt in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine controuerſyes of Religion, ſo differently maintayned by Catholikes and Proteſtants, as that graunting the maintaynours of the one ſide, to hould the truth, it followeth, that the other party vphouldeth falſehood and hereſy. Now for the more dangerous wounding of our Newtrali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Proteſtants heerein, I will omit here to ſpeak of the Controuerſies, touching Purgatory, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Saints, Free-will, Monachiſme, and diuers others ſuch like; and will reſtraine my ſelfe, only to theſe Controuerſies, the ſubiect of which Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

So as if it be ſhowed, that the Proteſtants and the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:150754:26"/> Catholiks do mainly diſſent in the meanes of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning grace, &amp; purchaſing of ſaluation; it muſt of neceſſity be inferred, that both the Proteſtants and the Catholikes continuing in ſuch their ſtate, cannot obtaine grace and ſaluation: ſince not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Philoſophy, but euen naturall reaſon teacheth vs, that he neuer shall attaine the end, who vſeth eyther not the ſame meanes, which are only and neceſſarily inſtituted to the gayning of the ſayd end.</p>

               <p n="9">9. Thus farre of theſe pointes, of which I haue made particuler choiſe to inſiſt vpon (omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome others of like nature) becauſe wee ſee, that moſt or all of them, do immediatly and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally (as is aboue ſayd) touch the meanes of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing of grace, of remiſſion of our ſinnes, and obtayning of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being maintayned for ſuch by the Catholikes, but vtterly denyed &amp; reiected by Proteſtants. And here I now vrge two things. Firſt, if theſe former doctrines, as they are belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the Catholikes, do immediatly concerne ſaluation, and become neceſſary meanes thereof, then cannot the Proteſtants (as reiecting all ſuch doctrines, and ſuch meanes both in beliefe &amp; pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe) be ſaued. But if (by a ſuppoſall) they be not of that nature, but falſe in themſelues, and the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:150754:30"/> contrary doctrines true, then cannot the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes (as beleeuing falſe doctrines immediatly tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching mans ſaluation, and accordingly practiſing them) be ſaued. From which forked argument, it may moſt demonſtratiuely be inferred, that it is impoſſible, that both the Catholiks and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants (the one part beleeuing, the other part not beleeuing the foreſayd doctrines) should both be ſaued; for who neglecteth neceſſary meanes, shall neuer attayne to the deſigned end of the ſayd meanes. Secondly, I vrge, that a falſe beliefe, not only in theſe articles, but alſo in any other Controuerſyes, betweene the Catholikes and the Proteſtants, is plaine Hereſy. And this, becauſe euery falſe beliefe, is comprehended within the definition of hereſy, as being in it ſelfe an electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; choiſe of a new or falſe doctrine, wilfully main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned againſt the Church of God; and therefore it followeth, that eyther the Catholikes or Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants for their perſiſting in this falſe beliefe, or hereſy, shalbe damned.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But heere I will ſtay my ſelfe; wading no further in the diſquiſition and ſearch of the great diſſentions betweene Catholikes and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, touching Fayth and beliefe; only I will reflect a little vpon the premiſes of the two laſt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:150754:30"/> Chapters. And heere, ſince it is made moſt eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, firſt, that the Proteſtants and Catholikes, do mainly differ in the ſenſe and conſtruction of the articles of the Creed, and conſequently (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſenſe and not the wordes make the creed) that they both do not beleeue one and the ſame Creed, but haue to themſelues ſeuerall Creedes. From whence ſufficiently is diſcouered, that want of vnity in fayth, among them both; which vnity is ſo neceſſarily required to mans ſaluation, as in the precedent Chapter is demonſtrated. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that though by ſuppoſition, they did beleeue the Creed, &amp; the ſenſe therof with an vnanimous conſent, yet it is proued, that there are diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther articles not contayned in the Creed, which are indifferently beleeued (as neceſſary to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) both by Catholike and Proteſtant. Thirdly, ſeeing alſo there are ſundry Controuerſies in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (as is aboue exemplifyed) which immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly concerne ſaluation, being houlden as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary meanes thereof, by the catholikes, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed from and abandoned by Proteſtants, as mayne errours and falſe doctrines, that therefore it is a manifeſt errour to make the Creed, the ſole rule of fayth.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Therefore from all the former premiſes,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:150754:31"/> I do auerre, that he, who maintayneth, that both Catholikes &amp; Proteſtants, and conſequently men of any Religion (notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that the one ſide doth neceſſarily beleeue and maintaine Hereſy, can be ſaued, or that euery Chriſtian can obtaine heauen, is wholy depriued of all true iudgement, reaſon and diſcourſe, and for want thereof, may deſeruedly be ranged among them, of whome the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh: <hi>Nolite fieri ſicut equus &amp; mulus, quibus non est intellectus. Do not become as Horſe and Mule, which haue no vnderſtanding.</hi>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:150754:34"/> aſſembled in the Apoſtles time, the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and reaſon thereof was, for that certaine contentious men, maintaining that the Gentiles, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted to the Chriſtian fayth, might eate meats offered vp to Idols, &amp; blood and ſtrangled beaſts, contrary to the cuſtome of the Iewes; the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les being aſſembled, &amp; bearing with the weaknes of the Iewes, in the infancy of the Church, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed the prohibition of eating blood and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled meates. After, which decree once eſtabliſhed, it is certaine, that it had bine a mortall ſinne im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly to haue eaten of blood, and ſtrangled meates; ſo as before it being a point of indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, is now made neceſſary. This appeareth from the text: firſt from thoſe wordes; <hi>Certaine going forth from vs, haue troubled you with wordes, ſubuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your ſoules.</hi> But men do neyther depart out of the Church, by maintaintng certaine opinions, nor by their example therein can they ſubuert o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens ſoules, if their doctrine and practiſe thereof, do ſtil remaine, about things indifferent; Secondly from that other paſſage. <hi>It hath ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt and vs, to lay, no further bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then vpon you, then theſe neceſſary thinges:</hi> where we find, that the prohibition of ſuch meates, is ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Apoſtles, in regard of thoſe tymes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moung

               <p n="6">6. Now from the example of this Councell, I do gather, that if a Councell by its owne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity may decree, that the eating of certaine meates (being otherwayes of their owne nature indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to be eaten without ſinne) ſhalbe vnlawful, and ſhall repute and hould the impugners there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of for men departed from out of the Church of Chriſt; then <hi>a fortiori,</hi> what doctrine ſoeuer a Councell ſhall condemne of its owne nature for hereſy, the ſame is to be reputed, by all good Chriſtians for hereſy, and the defendours thereof for Heretikes.</p>

                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">Iure Canon. c. <hi>10.</hi> de Haeretic.</note> 
                  <hi>in fide, infidelis est.</hi> Therfore to the beliefe of any one article of fayth, two things doe concurre: the one, is the <hi>firſt reuealing verity</hi> (as the ſchoolemen ſpeake) which is God himſelfe: the ſecond is the Church, propounding the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to be beleeued. Now when we beleeue any point of fayth, God, who is the <hi>first reuealing veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> (as is ſayd) reuealeth it to the Church, and the Church propoundeth it ſo reuealed, to vs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue; and thus we beleeue a point of fayth, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the authority of God reuealing, and the Churche propounding. And this is moſt conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and agreeing, with that moſt admirable and infallible rule of fayth, ſet downe by the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis,</hi> in the beginning of his <hi>Commonitorium,</hi> deſeruing to be ſtamped in chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of gold: <hi>I</hi>
                  <note n="(c)" place="margin">Initio commoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torij.</note> 
                  <hi>haue demanded</hi> (ſayth this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour) <hi>very many thinges, of many men, excelling &amp; renowned for learning, and ſanctity of life, how, and by what way, I might fortify my fayth, in tyme of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſyes aryſing: and I euer receaued this anſwere of all, or in manner of all, that whether I, or any other, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to auoyd the ſnares of Heretikes, and to continue ſound in the Catholike fayth, he muſt by Gods aſsiſtance,</hi> Fidem munire duplici ratione: <hi>fenſe his fayth with
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:150754:49"/> a double reaſon;</hi> Sacroſancti Canonis authoritate; deinde Eccleſiae Catholicae traditione. <hi>Firſt by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Gods word: ſecondly, by tradition of the Catholike Church.</hi> Thus farre Vincentius. Thus we ſee, where we beleeue any thing, though it be <hi>materially</hi> true, and not through this former au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, this is not ſupernaturall beliefe in vs, but only an opinion grounded vpon other reaſons &amp; inducements. Euen as the Turke beleeueth, that there is one God, Creatour of the world, yet this his beleefe is no true fayth, but only an opinion of a thing, which is true; ſince this his beliefe, is grounded only vpon his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> being otherwiſe a fabulous booke, though of the being of one God, it ſpeaketh truly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now to apply this to my purpoſe. This <hi>first reuealing verity,</hi> which is God (through whoſe authority wee ought to beleeue euery article of fayth) doth with one and the like authority, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale all articles of Chriſtian Religion; ſo as it is as forcibly to be beleeued, that there is (for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) a Purgatory, or that we may pray to to Saints (ſuppoſe theſe articles to be true) as that there is a Trinity, or that Chriſt was incarnated. From whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it ineuitably followeth, that who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth in the Trinity, and yet doth not beleeue
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:150754:49"/> that there is a Purgatory, or that we may pray to Saints, hath no true and ſupernaturall beliefe of the Trinity; but only beleeueth that there is a Trinity, becauſe he is perſuaded thereto, only by his owne reaſon, or through ſome other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane authority. For if he did beleeue, that there is a Trinity, or that Chriſt was incarnate through the authority of God ſo reuealing this truth, ſo to be beleeued, by the ſame authority he would haue beleeued, that there is a Purgatory, and that we ought to pray to Saints, ſeeing both the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Trinity, and of Purgatory, or pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Saints, are equally, and indifferently alike propounded by God, and by his Church to be beleeued.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And ſeeing to the ſame authority, euer the ſame reuerence, affiance, and credit is to be giuen, thus we may demonſtratiuely conclude, that what Proteſtant doth beleeue in the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and yet doth not beleeue, that there is Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, Praying to Saints, Freewill, the Reall preſence (admitting them once to be true) or any other points controuerted, betweene the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes and the Proteſtants, the ſame man hath no true fayth of the Trinity, of the Incarnation, and conſequently for want of a true, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:150754:50"/> fayth cannot be ſaued, ſince we reade: <hi>Qui non</hi>

                  <hi>credit, condemnabitur. VVho beleeueth not, shalbe condemned.</hi> And from this former ground it it proceedeth, that S. <hi>Thomas,</hi>

               <p n="4">4. Another reaſon may be taken from a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of fayth vſed by the learned, which faith is of two ſorts: the one they call <hi>Explicite fayth,</hi> the other <hi>Implicite. Explicite fayth</hi> is that, which all men vnder paine of damnation, are bound ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely to beleeue, as the Trinity, the Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:150754:50"/> of our Sauiour, his paſſion, the Decalogue, or ten Commandements &amp;c. <hi>Implicite fayth</hi> is that which comprehendeth all thoſe pointes, which a man is not bound expreſſely and diſtinctly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in particuler (though he be expreſſely bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not to beleeue any thing contrary therto) but is to reſt in the iudgment of the Church, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning all ſuch points, and what the Church of Chriſt houldeth therein, implicitly to beleeue. This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction is warranted, not only in the iudgment of all Catholike ſchoole men, but alſo in the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement of the moſt learned<note n="(g)" place="margin">D.

                  <hi>the Controuerſies of Religion in our tyme, are growne in number ſo many, and in nature ſo intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, that few haue tyme, and leaſure, fewer strength of vnderſtanding to examine them, what remayneth for men deſirous of ſatisfaction in things of ſuch conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but diligently to ſearch out, which among all the ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes of men in the world, is that bleſſed company of holy ones, that houſehould of fayth, that ſpouſe of Chriſt, &amp; Church of the liuing God, which is the pillar and ground of truth, that ſo they may imbrace her communion, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her directions, and reſt in her iudgments.</hi> Thus
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:150754:51"/> Doctor Field.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now this diſtinction being preſuppoſed, I thus argue, both theſe kinds of faith, are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſaluation. <hi>Explicite faith,</hi> becauſe it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth, all thoſe fundamental and ſupreme points of Chriſtian Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without the expreſſe and articulate knowledge of which a man cannot be ſaued. And theſe be thoſe only, which Newtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts in Religion hould neceſſary to be belieued: <hi>Implicite faith,</hi> of other points alſo is neceſſary to ſaluation, becauſe otherwyſe then beleiuing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely &amp; inuoluedly what the Church teacheth therin, we cannot (according to the former Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours wordes) find out <hi>that bleſſed company of holy ones, the houſehould of fayth, the ſpouſe of Chriſt, &amp; Church of the liuing God.</hi> And ſeeing <hi>Implicite fayth,</hi> is neceſſary to ſaluation, we muſt graunt, that this <hi>Implicite fayth</hi> hath ſome obiect; the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect is not the article of the Trinity, the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Decalogue &amp;c. ſince theſe are the obiects of <hi>Explicite fayth</hi> (as is aboue intimated) therfore articles ſeeming of leſſer importance, are the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of <hi>implicite fayth;</hi> the which as a man is bound implicitly to beleeue in the fayth of the Church, ſo is he bound not to beleeue any thing contrary to the ſayd articles. Seeing then diuers controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:150754:51"/> betweene the Catholikes and the Proteſtants, are included vnder this <hi>implicite faith,</hi> and that the Church of God, houldeth but one way of them: it followeth that one ſide of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary beleiuers of thoſe points doth erre in their beliefe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently through want of this true &amp; neceſſary <hi>implicite fayth,</hi> cannot be ſaued.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A third reaſon, may be this. It is proper, &amp; peculier to vertues infuſed (&amp; ſuch be Fayth, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe, &amp; Charity) that euery ſuch vertue is wholely extinguiſhed by any one act contrary to the ſayd vertue. Thus for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, one mortal ſinne, taketh away al charity &amp; grace, according that: <hi>He</hi>
                  <note n="(i)" place="margin">Iacob. cap. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>that offendeth in one, is made guilty of all.</hi> One act of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire, deſtroyeth the whole vertue of Hope; then by the ſame reaſon, one hereſy wholely corrupteth &amp; extinguisheth all true fayth. Therefore ſeeing Fayth is a Theologicall, and infuſed vertue, this fayth is deſtroyed with one act of hereſy, whether it be about Purgatory, Prayer to Saints, Freewil, or any other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſy between the Catholiks &amp; the Proteſtants; therfore whoſeuer denyeth Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, or any of the reſt (granting their doctrins to be true) is depriued of all infuſed fayth tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching any article of Chriſtian Religion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they concerne the Trinity, or the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:150754:52"/> or any other fundamentall point, which he may ſeeme to beleeue: but <hi>without fayth</hi> (that is, without true, infuſed, and Theological faith) <hi>it is impoſsible to pleaſe God,</hi> as the<note n="(k)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</note> Apoſtle aſſureth vs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another reaſon may be this; Theſe New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traliſts in Religion, doe not agree euen in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral grounds of Chriſtian faith, to wit, in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of one God, of the Trinity, of Chriſt &amp;c. with any other Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. This is proued, becauſe as all other Chriſtians, do beleeue in theſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heads; ſo doth each of them particulerly agree, that theſe generall principles are to be limited &amp; bounded to euery ones particuler ſecte, as the Proteſtant (for example) beleeueth otherwayes in God, the Trinity, and Chriſt, then the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes doe (as is els where demonſtrated) But now theſe our Newtraliſts, doe not limit the foreſayde principles, to any particuler ſect, or in any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer manner; therefore it euidently followeth, that they haue no true beliefe, euen of thoſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and fundamentall articles.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A fift reaſon shalbe this. It is moſt certaine, that what generall propenſion, Nature (or rather God himſelfe, by nature as his inſtrument) hath ingrafted in all men, the ſame is in it ſelfe, moſt
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:150754:52"/> true, certaine, and warrantable. As for example, Nature hath implanted in ech mans ſoule, a ſecret remorſe of Conſcience for ſinnes and tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons committed, as alſo a feare of future punishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be inflicted for the ſayd ſinnes perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: therefore from hence it may infallibly be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that ſinne it ſelfe is to be auoyded, &amp; that after this life there is a retribution of punishment, for our offenſes done in this world; ſince other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes it would follow, that God should inſert in the ſoule of man (idly, vainly and as directed to no end) certaine naturall impreſſions &amp; inſtincts, which to affirme were moſt derogatory to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine maieſty and wiſedome, &amp; repugnant to that anciently receaued Axiome: <hi>God, &amp; Nature wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothing in vaine.</hi> Now to apply this, we find both by hiſtory, and by experience, that diuers zealous and feruent Profeſſours of all Religions whatſoeuer (both true and falſe) haue beene moſt ready to expoſe their liues in defence of any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned part, or branch of their Religion, from which vndaunted reſolution of theirs, we certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly collect, that this their conſtant determination of defending the leaſt point of their Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth partly from a generall inſtinct of God, impreſſed in mans ſoule, teaching each man, that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:150754:53"/> death it ſelfe is rather to be ſuffered, then we are to deny any part of fayth and Religion in generall. And thus according hereto, we find that the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, who were Heathens (though they did erre touching the particuler obiect herein, as worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping falſe Gods) were moſt cautelous, that no one point should be infringed or violated touching the worshiping of their Gods. The like religious ſeuerity was practiſed by the Iewes, as <hi>Ioſephus</hi>
                  <note n="(l)" place="margin">Cont. Apion.</note> witneſſeth. And God himſelfe euen in his owne writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> word threatneth, that, <hi>VVho</hi>
                  <note n="(m)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Apo.</hi> 22.</note> 
                  <hi>shall eyther adde or diminish to the booke of the Apocalips, written by the Euangeliſt, from him he will take away his part out of the booke of life.</hi> Now if ſuch da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger be threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for adding to, or taking fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more or leſſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was ſet downe by the <hi>Euangelist</hi> in this one booke, how can then both the Catholiks and Proteſtants haue their names writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the booke of life? Since it is certaine and granted on all ſides, that eyther the Catholike addeth more to the fayth of Chriſt, then was by him inſtituted, or the Proteſtant ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth from the ſayd fayth diuers articles, which Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles did teach. But to returne to our former reaſon: From al this, we deduce, that no points of true Religion, are of ſuch cold indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, as that they are not much to be regarded,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:150754:53"/> or that they may be maintayned co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarywayes by contrary ſpirits, without any danger to mans ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; but that they are of that nature, worth, &amp; dignity, as a man is to vndergo all torments, yea death it ſelfe, before he yeald, or ſuffer the leaſt relapſe in denying any of the ſayd verityes.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſixt and laſt reaſon, to proue that the maintayning of falſe doctrins now queſtioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the Chriſtians of theſe tymes, are moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudicial &amp; hurtful to the obtaining of our heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly bliſſe, wherin at this tyme I wil inſiſt, may be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the conſideration of the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t effects, which the contrary doctrines betweene the Catholiks &amp; the Proteſtants produce in mans ſoule, touching the exerciſing of vertue or vice: ſince moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted it is, that the beleeuing of ſuch opinions which of their owne nature do impel, &amp; as it were viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly draw the ſoule to vice, looſenes, &amp; impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of manners &amp; conuerſation, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſtand with the hope of eternal happines. And the chief reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hereof (beſids others) is this, in that the wil, which is the ſeate of vertue or vice, doth neceſſarily and irreſiſtably worke, as the vnderſtanding (in which reſide fayth &amp; all falſe doctrines) doth dictate to the wil: now then the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding being infected with hereſies, te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding directly to the pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting of vice
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:150754:54"/> eradicating of all vertue in the ſoule, it of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty follweth, that the will muſt worke and exerciſe it ſelfe according to thoſe falſe principles, which the vnderſtanding ſuggeſteth to the will for true, and that with the greater facility, in regard of the prones of mans nature (through our firſt Parents fall) inclined to liberty, pleaſure, and ſenſuality. But becauſe the ſubiect of this reaſon is a lardge field wherin to walke, &amp; the truth therof is to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by ſeuerall inſtances, drawne from diuers particuler doctrines, maintained at this preſent by the Proteſtants, and all breathing nothing, but vice, diſſolution, and all turpitude in manners; therfore I will reſerue the next enſuing chapter, for the fuller manifeſtation of the truth in this point.</p>

               <p>IF there were no other reaſon to be alleadged in diſprouffe and confutation of this plurality of Religions (ſo to tearme it) then this following, it might ſeeme fully preuayling in all cleare iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gments, not wholely darkened with the miſt of earthly and temporal reſpects: Firſt the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ireconcileable booke-warrs betwene Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes and Proteſtants, wholely vndertaken in defence of their ſeuerall Religions: Secondly the preſſures and calamities, with which diuers ſtats &amp; Countreys do afflict other ſtates, as alſo the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection

Witneſſes hereof are the libraries of al the famous Vniuerſities of Chriſtendome, the Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners shoppes in all great Citties, and laſtly the yearely Mart of books returned theſe many years from <hi>Franckefort.</hi> And is it poſſible, that ſo much paines, trauaile, and labour of writing, &amp; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes accompanied with ſo great charges of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, should be vndertaken for queſtions only of indifferency, and ſuch as it importeth nothing at all, touching the gayning of Heauen &amp; auoiding of Hell, what a man beleiueth therin, or of what ſide he relyeth.</p>

The laſt threeſcore years, as alſo theſe very times, do giue ouer lamentable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples heerof. Witneſſes of this matter (purpoſely to forbeare the preſidents of our owne Country) is Scotland, into which Countrey <hi>Knox, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and <hi>Bocanan</hi> with other their Agents and confederats, firſt introduced Proteſtancy by force and armes; a point ſo acknowledged, that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Bancroft,</hi> the late pretended Archbishop of Canterbury, as wholely inueighing againſt ſuch violent courſes, made a booke entituling it: <hi>Of the proceeding of the Scottishe Miniſtres according to the Geneuian rules of reformation.</hi>

For it is certaine, that theſe contrary partyes did agree and conſpire, in the generall beliefe of the Trinity, Incarnation, Paſſion, death of our Sauiour, and verbally reciting of the Apoſtles Creed.</p>

               <p n="4">4. Againe it depriueth Chriſtian faith of its true marke or Character of <hi>Vnity,</hi> ſo much celebrated by the Apoſtle. Now then if vnity of faith be neceſſary to Saluation, how can both Catholikes and Proteſtants, expect ſaluation? Seeing there is no greater diſtance betweene the oppoſite parts of a <hi>Diameter,</hi> then there is repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnancy betweene both their beleifes.

               <p n="5">5. But to proceede further touching the foreſaid want of vnity &amp; diſagreements; if euery Chriſtian might be ſaued in his owne Religion, then might thoſe be ſaued, which beleiue the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Creed in a moſt differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſence &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, then which, what can be more rashly &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly ſpoken? For ſeeing there is but one true intended ſence by the Apoſtles of the Creede, which if we attaine not, then doe we beleiue, that which is falſe; but to beleeue the Creede in a falſe
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:150754:77"/> ſence is no better, then not to beleiue it at all, as is aboue ſaid, and therefore it would followe by way of inference, that he might be ſaued, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiued not any one article of the Creede at all. Now that the Catholikes &amp; Proteſtants do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiue the articles of the Creede in different (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrary) ſenſes, (and conſequently that the one ſide beleiueth it in a falſe and erroneous ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe) is aboue proued in the fourth chapter.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If it be here replyed, that the maintainers of this doctrine do ſo farre yeald, that they only are to be ſaued, which in a true ſence beleeue the Creed; yet by this their reſtrainct they condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne all thoſe others, which beleeue it in any other ſenſe different from that, intended by the Holy Ghoſt and the Apoſtles; and conſequently, they condemne in their iudgment and depriue of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, either the Catholikes or the Proteſtants; ſince of neceſſity, the one of theſe do beleeue the Creed, not in its true ſenſe, but in a falſe and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall ſence and conſtruction, different from that of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But granting that the Catholikes and Proteſtants beleeue the Creed, in one true ſence intended by the holy Ghoſt; yet if our Newtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts would haue the Creed the ſquare or rule,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:150754:77"/> thereby to meaſure our fayth, then marke the abſurdityes following: For by this doctrine one might be ſaued, who beleeued 1. <hi>Not that there were any Scriptures at all written by the Prophets &amp; Apostles (ſince the Creed maketh no mention of any ſuch diuine writinges.)</hi> 2. <hi>In like ſort he might be ſaued, who did not beleeue, there were any Angells or Diuels.</hi> 3. <hi>Or that there is a materiall place of Hell.</hi> 4. <hi>Or that the paynes thereof are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</hi> 5. <hi>Or that Adam did preſently vpon his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation fall from grace, and therby tranſported original ſinne vpon all his posterity.</hi> 6. <hi>Or that our Sauiour whileſt he conuerſed heere vpon earth, wrought any miracles.</hi> 7. <hi>Or made choice of certaine men to be his Apostles, to preach the Chriſtian fayth throughout the whole worlde.</hi> 8. <hi>Or that Circumſicion is now forbidden and antiquated.</hi> 9. <hi>Or that there are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sacraments of the new testament, as Baptiſme, the Euchariſt &amp;c.</hi> 10. <hi>Or that finally before the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the world, a deſigned ennemy of Christ shall come, who is tearmed Antichriſt.</hi> I ſay by our New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traliſts Religion, he ſhould be ſaued, who belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued none of the foreſayd articles, ſeeing not any one of them is expreſſed or ſet downe in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles creed; and yet the beliefe of the ſayd ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, is neceſſarily exacted &amp; required to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:150754:78"/> both in the iudgments of the Catholikes &amp; the Proteſtants, both which partyes do with an vnanimous conſent, teach the neceſſity of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the ſayd articles.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But to proceed further, &amp; to come to the different articles of fayth, differently beleeued by the Catholikes &amp; Proteſtants; and yet not expreſſed in the Creed, &amp; articles of ſuch nature, as that they are houlden by the Catholikes to be inſtituted by our Sauiour, as ſubordinate (yet neceſſary) meanes of the grace of God, and of ſaluation; whereas the Proteſtants, as not belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing at all the ſayd articles, do wholely diſclayme from acknowledging all ſuch meanes. Theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles I haue recited aboue, to wit, 1. <hi>That Sacraments in generall do conferre grace.</hi> 2. <hi>That a childe dying without baptiſme, cannot be ſaued.</hi> 3. <hi>That mortall ſinne is not remitted without the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Pennance and confeſsion.</hi> 4. <hi>That we are to adore with ſupreme honour the Bleſſed Sacrament.</hi> 5. <hi>That not only fayth, but alſo workes do iustify man.</hi> 6. <hi>That a Christian, by thinking himſelfe to be iust, is not thereby become iust.</hi> 7. <hi>That euery Chriſtian hath ſufficient grace offered by God to ſaue his ſoule, &amp; that therefore God on his part would haue all men ſaued.</hi> 8. <hi>That without keeping the tenne
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:150754:78"/> commandements a man cannot be ſaued.</hi> 9. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>that all Christians, ought vpon payne of eternall damnation to communicate in ſacraments and doctrine with the church of Rome, and to ſubmit themſelues in al due obedience to the ſupreme paſtour of Gods church.</hi> In al which points the Proteſtants do beleeue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly the contrary, condemning vs of hereſy, ſuperſtition, yea idolatry, for our belieuing the foreſayd points. Now I ſay, ſeeing the former articles do immediatly touch &amp; concerne either remiſſion of our ſinnes, or grace of our ſoule, or our iuſtification, or our due honour adoration to our Sauiours body being accompanied with his diuinity, or laſtly our communion with Chriſt his church, and the head therof, in any of which (as concerning ſo nearely our eternall happines) who erreth, cannot poſſibly be ſaued.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And ſeeing the Proteſtants (as is ſayd) do in all the ſayd points maintaine the iuſt contrary to the Catholikes, and thereby do abandone the Catholikes acknowledged meanes of their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I heare aske in all ſobernes of iudgment, what can be reputed for a greater abſurdity, then to affirme with our Newtraliſts, that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes and Proteſtants (notwithſtanding their ſo different and contrary beliefe, and anſwearble
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:150754:79"/> practiſe in the former articles, ſo neerely tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching mans ſaluation) may both be ſaued? See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it muſt needs be, that either the Catholikes shalbe damned for ſetting downe certaine means of our ſaluation, contrary to Chriſts mind and inſtitution (ſuppoſing the ſayd means to be falſe) or that the Proteſtants shalbe damned for reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the former meanes of Saluation inſtituted by Chriſt, admitting them to be true.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But to paſſe forward: If euery Chriſtian might be ſaued in his Religion, in beleuing only the fundamentall points of the Trinity, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, &amp;c. then hath the Church of Chriſt euen in her primitiue dayes (at what time the Proteſtants themſelues<note n="(h)" place="margin">See of this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the Apology of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d written by Doctor Iewel, Kemnit. in exam.

               <p n="12">12. But now graunting that the ſayd points as they were houlden by the maintainers of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) were not Hereſies, &amp; that the beleiuers of them might be ſaued, then two maine abſurdityes doe ineuitably follow. The firſt is, the erring of the whole Church of God in condemning them for hereſies, they being not Hereſies, but true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, as is ſaid. The ſecond, the inconſiderate carriadge of the church in theſe matters: For to what purpoſe or end, were all theſe councells (conſiſting of many hundreds of the moſt graue and Reuerend men of all chriſtendome) celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſuch labour and trauaile out of all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and infinite chardges, if the doctrines (for the impugning, reſiſting, &amp; condemning wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they were gathered) might be indifferently maintayned and defended on all ſides, without breach of true faith, or danger of ſaluation? The erring of the Church is no leſſe manifeſted
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:150754:80"/> in the ſentences and condemnation giuen by many of the moſt ancient, famous, &amp; learned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the primitiue Church (not any one or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxall Father contradicting them therein) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt diuers, maintayning opinions, that ſeeme, in (regard or the Trinity, the Incarnation &amp;c) of ſmall importance; if ſo theſe opinions be not hereſies, nor the beleiuers of them Heretikes, but men in ſtate of ſaluation.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And thus according hereto <hi>Florinus,</hi> though he taught God to be the authour of ſinne, might be ſaued. In like ſort the Heretikes, who in S. <hi>Hieromes</hi> dayes, denyed the poſſibility of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, the Manichees, who denyed Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, the Eunomians, who taught that only faith did iuſtify. The Aerians, who denyed prayer and ſacrifice for the dead, and tooke away all faſting-dayes. Vigilantius, who taught that Prieſts might marry, &amp; that we ought not pray to Saints. Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinian, who helde mariadge to be better then virginity; The Donatiſts, who taught the inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Church. And finally (to omit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others for breuity ſake). The Pelagians, who denyed the neceſſity of Baptiſme in Children. All theſe men (I ſay) might be ſaued, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the former doctrines, if ſo euery one
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:150754:81"/> might expect ſaluation in their Religion. And yet we finde, that the foreſaid men, were branded for wicked Heretikes, &amp; their doctrines for damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hereſies (as in the ſeauenth chapter aboue is showed) by S. <hi>Irenaeus, S. Hierome, S. Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Philaſtrius, S. Augustine, Theodoret,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; diuers of theſe holy Fathers wryting Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogues of Hereſies, did place the foreſaid do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and their authours within the ſaid Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues, and this they did without any reluctation or gaineſaying of any other ancient and learned Father of their tymes.</p>
               <p n="14">14. From which conſideration I do gather, that if thoſe opinions were not iuſtly condemned for hereſies, and their authours for Heretikes; then not only the Church did fondly erre in ſo great a matter, but alſo the aforeſayd alleadged Fathers (to wit) <hi>S. Irenaeus, S. Hierome, Epiphani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, S. Augustine</hi> with many ſuch others, should deſeruedly be reputed for Heretikes, for their condemning of true doctrines for hereſies, and the beleeuers of them for heretikes; and on the contrary ſide Florinus, the Maniches, the Euno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians, Vigilantius, Iouinian, the Donatiſts, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius, and many other ſuch, should be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their teaching of true doctrins, orthodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xall
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:150754:81"/> Fathers and authours, and might haue iuſtly complayned of their inſupportable wronges, and indignityes proceeding from the pennes of the foreſayd Fathers: an abſurdity, which I thinke no man, enioying the benefit of his fiue ſenſes, will allow: And yet the admittance of our New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traliſts paradox, inauoydably draweth on this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Another abſurdity accompanying the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer doctrine, is, that Heretikes should be true members of Chriſts church. This I deduce. For ſeeing by the conſent of all learned men, none can be ſaued, but ſuch as be members of Chriſts Church (for otherwayes Turks and Iewes dying in that ſtate might be ſaued) and ſeeing the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd regiſtred doctrines, and the authours are condemned for hereſies and Heretikes, both by the authority of Gods Church, and according to the true definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hereſy aboue ſet downe (for the foreſayd Heretikes made choyce of thoſe their hereſies, and did maintaine them moſt fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly againſt the whole Church of God, not ſubmitting their iudgments to it) it muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity follow, that if thoſe men could be ſaued, then Heretikes continuing Heretikes, are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt his Church; then which, what pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:150754:82"/> in it ſelfe can be accounted more abſurde, or in the iudgment of learned men more incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible? Conſidering with what acerbity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portement, the Apoſtles &amp; all the orthodoxall, learned, &amp; pious Fathers, both in their writings &amp; otherwiſe, haue in all ages entertained Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, as aboue I haue manifeſted in the ſixth Chapter.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Againe, ſuppoſing the truth of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Omnifidians (as I may tearme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) yet obſerue how repugnant it is to all reaſon, &amp; otherwiſe abſurd euen in its owne nature. I will heere paſſe ouer diuers reaſons alleadged in the precedent chapter, and inſiſt a little in ſome few of them. The firſt: It is certaine, that that faith which belieueth ſome articls, &amp; yet belieueth not others, which are no leſſe true (&amp; ſuch is the faith of our Newtraliſts) is no true ſupernatural fayth; ſeeing it beleeueth nothing thorough the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God &amp; his Church, both which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale and propound all articles alike &amp; indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to al men to be beleeued. Now what more croſſe to reaſon, then that a bare opinion (not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying vpon any ſupernaturall grounds, as hauing neither God for its <hi>Reuealer,</hi> nor the Church for its <hi>propounder</hi>) conceaued only through moral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements

               <p n="17">17. Againe how aduerſe is it to all true iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to auerre, that it is no preiudice or hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to mans ſaluation, to beleeue thoſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Religion, which teach &amp; aduance all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty &amp; ſenſuality in conuerſation and manners, &amp; do depreſſe and diſparadge all chaſtity, faſting voluntary pouerty, keeping of the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, all rigorous and painefull workes, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of vertue, piety, and mortification?

Furthermore, can it be conceaued, as ſorting to Gods moſt mercifull proceeding with man, that he should cut off the liues of thoſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with moſt feareful, ſodaine, &amp; prodigious deaths, who firſt broached the doctrines of Proteſtancy, if the ſayd doctrines had eyther bene true in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

In vaine alſo then haue the learned men on both ſides, ſpent out their whole liues, in defending (each man his owne Religion) in their moſt paineful and volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous bookes &amp; writtings, if ſo they diſſented one from another in matters of ſuch ſuppoſed ſmall importance.

               <p n="20">20. What can we now reply hereto in behalfe of our Newtraliſts? Shall we ſay, that the moſt learned men of all Religions, the Kings, Princes, States, and all their ſubiects of all Chriſtendome, were and ſtill are actually madd, and out of their ſenſes, in managing theſe their deplorable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptes for Religion; and that our all reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and peaceable Newtraliſts (who through his pliable ſterne of diſpoſition in theſe ſpirituall matters, is become in kindred, as aboue is tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:150754:84"/> of the halfe blood with the Atheiſt, and who is commonly deprehended to want learning grace, and vertue) is peculiarly enlightened by God in ſetting downe what articles of fayth are only neceſſary to mans ſaluation, and what are to be reputed, but as acceſſary, and of ſmaller importance? To ſuch ſtraites (we ſee) is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the former doctrine driuen vnto. Seeing therefore this doctrine of our <hi>Omnifidians,</hi> or <hi>Nullifidians</hi> (for indeed while they ſeeme to allow all Religions, they take away all Religion) is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed on all ſides with ſo many notorious abſurdityes (as are diſplayed in this Chapter) &amp; ſeeing it cannot be true, except there be a retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation of all matters heere on earth, and a turning of the world (as they ſay) vpſide downe, that is, except the moſt learned become moſt madd, and the moſt ignorant, moſt wiſe. And except truth in doctrine be neceſſarily to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed with infinite groſſe abſurdityes, and errour and falſehood fortifyed and countenaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with ſtore of proofes both diuine &amp; humane, as if God did purpoſely lay trappes to enſnare mans iudgment. Therefore, ſince ſuch compor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tement and carriage of things, is not ſutable and correſpondent to Gods prouidence and charity
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:150754:85"/> towardes mankind, let euery man (who thinketh he hath a ſoule to ſaue or looſe) vndoubtedly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure himſelfe, that there is but one true fayth or religion, wherein he may auayleably expect ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and that this fayth of Chriſt, (wherewith the ſoule is clothed) is like to the inconſutible garment of Chriſt, both being incapable of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion, renting, or partition.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Now for the greater illuſtration of this point, by way of ſimilitude, and as tending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the cloſure of this treatiſe. Imagine that a man pretendeth right and title to certaine lands, and taketh aduiſe of all the learned Lawyers and Counſailours of the whole Realme, to whome he showeth all his euidences, of which ſome do cary a title only in groſſe and in general; others proue a more particuler and more reſtrayned right to the ſayd lands; Imagine further, that vpon the diligent peruſall of the euidences, the ioynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent &amp; iudgments of all the ſayd Lawyers, ſhould after their longe and ſerious demurs, conſpire in this one point, to wit, that for the recouering and obtayning of the ſayd lands, the foreshewed euidences in generall are not only ſufficient; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diuers other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not hauing any true intereſt in the lands, may neuertheleſſe inſiſt and vrge

It now remayneth to show, that ſeeing at this day there are originally, but two different religions among Chriſtians, to wit, the Catholike Religion and the Proteſtant, (within which is included all its branches &amp; deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendents) whether the Catholike or Proteſtant Religion is that wherin a man may be ſaued: But ſeeing this ſubiect is moſt learnedly and paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully entreated of by many Catholike wryters, who from all authorityes both diuine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, haue irrefragably euicted the truth of their owne religion, and falſehood of the Proteſtants profeſſion; and conſequently that in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, not in the Proteſtant faith, the ſoules eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſaluation is to be purchaſed: therfore I do remit the Reader for his greater ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, to the peruſall of the ſaid books, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerly to the ſtudying (rather then to the reading) of that moſt elaborate, learned, vnanſwereable, and gauling worke of the proteſtants Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:150754:87"/> of the Roman Churche.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Only before I heere end, I muſt make bould to put him in remembrance, with what the Proteſtant Religion in this treatiſe (though but caſually and incidently) is moſt truly chard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; to wit, firſt with particuler condemnations paſſed vpon diuers of its cheifeſt articles, euen by the ſeuerall ſentences and iudgments of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, and that therfore thoſe doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſo condemned, and yet after defended with all froward pertinacity againſt the Church of God, are not only therby diſcouered for plaine, and manifeſt hereſies, but furthermore both im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely by the teſtimony of holy ſcripture, as alſo by the definition of Hereſy aboue expreſſed. Secondly, that the doctrinall ſpeculations &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of the Proteſtants faith doe forceibly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the willes of ſuch as beleiue them, to all vice, liberty and ſenſuality. Thirdly, that God out of the infinite abyſſe of his Iuſtice, hath punished euen in this worlde, (as earneſt giuen of far gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the world to come) with moſt fearefull, vnnaturall and prodigions deathes, the firſt inuentours in our age and promulgatours of the ſaid doctrines; and ſuch deaths, as his diuine maieſty is accuſtomed to ſend to his profeſſed
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:150754:88"/> ennemies. Fourthly, that Proteſtancy is torne a ſunder with inteſtine diuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, diuers profeſſors of it, chardging their brethren profeſſours with Hereſie, and diſpayring of their future ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="25">25. From all which we may infalliby conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, that except Hereſy, diſſolution of manners, moſt infamous &amp; miſerable deaths and diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in doctrine between one &amp; the ſame ſect, be good diſpſitions and meanes to purchaſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, the Proteſtant Religion can neuer bring her beleiuers therto. What then remaineth, but that, who will expect ſaluation, should ſeeke it only in the Catholike Church? It being that Arke, ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by our ſecond <hi>Noe</hi> within which who vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly liue, are exempted from that vniuerſall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge of eternall damnation.
